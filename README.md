# spam-email-detection

In our daily life, we get lots of emails. Some emails are useful and some are not. An unsolicited email sent in the bulk is a spam email. We do not generally want spam emails, so spam classifiers throw them in spam folders before they appear in our inbox section.


Naive Bayes classifiers are the classifiers that are based on Bayesâ€™ theorem, a theorem that gives the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. It can be used to build a naive but good enough spam classifier, and we will see its use using a Python machine learning library, Sklearn.
